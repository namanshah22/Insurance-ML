## Introduction
In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the insurance dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between various features. We also build machine learning models to predict insurance charges based on the given data. The main goal is to showcase the application of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and different regression models for insurance analysis.

## Data
The insurance dataset used in this project contains information about individuals including their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region, along with their corresponding insurance charges.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter notebook Insurance-ML.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform EDA and build the machine learning models.
- Adjust the code according to your needs or experiment with different algorithms and parameters.
- Make sure to update the file paths if your dataset is located in a different directory.

## Results
The results of the analysis and modeling are presented within the Jupyter notebook. The models are evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics. The best parameters for the support vector regression (SVR) model are also reported.
